-- This is a very simple schema for a chrome.storage implementation. Even though
-- the spec allows for a single extension to have any number of "keys", we've
-- made the decision to store all keys for a given extension in a single row as
-- a JSON representation of all keys and values.
-- We've done this primarily due to:
-- * The shape of the API is very JSON, and it almost encourages multiple keys
--   to be fetched at one time.
-- * The defined max sizes that extensions are allowed to store using this API
--   is sufficiently small that we don't have many concerns around record sizes.
-- * We'd strongly prefer to keep one record per extension when syncing this
--   data, so having the local store in this shape makes syncing easier.

       We can iterate here as we site up sync support.
